+ added a patch I made  to fix export problem with format-text-direction-ltr in git from gnome.org. The gnome.org version has 17x16 size because the horizontal line on the arrow is one pix too long. The rectangle exports with the icon and black rectangle shows up in exported icon. This patch fixes issues, works when I applied to head & tested with ruby :)
